# config-example

Add `config.js` to `.gitignore` file

Include `config.js.example` to your project to let other developers what the config object looks like. This fill WILL be part of your repo but won't include actual values.

```
# include path to config file in gitignore
config/config.js

# include path to config file in gitignore (root level file)
anotherconfig.js

# or you can include the entire folder
# config
```
